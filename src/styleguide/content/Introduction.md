**The Store Styleguide** consists in a collection of foundational elements (colors, text styles, icons), UI components and UX guidelines for their usage.

### Goals of The Store Styleguide 

- **Platform agnostic**: it works in any browser and device (except IE11 and below)
- **Guidance**: empowers non-designers to confidently build brand-aligned, accessible user interfaces
- **Reusability**: encourages the [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
- **Homogeneity**: makes UI's look similar, which brings familiarity and simplicity of use to the users
- **Speed**: helps designers and developers to build apps faster
- **Innovation**: it's a living document and should be kept updated by the team with new components, patterns and innovations
- **Documentation**: it's a reference of how to do things for designers and developers
